                In this project, we designed an interactive prototype by using
                <em>Figma</em> for Allara's website based on the problems they
                face on their original website. Allara is a company that
                provides virtual care for women's hormonal and metabolic health.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the project brief provided by our client, we
                communicated with our client to clarify our understanding of the
                target customers, problems faced on their original website, and
                some ideas on the complexity of the final design.

              During these three weeks of working together, we went from sketch
              to high-fidelity model. Our goal was not to design the best
              registration process in the world, but to improve the flaws of the
              original design as much as possible. Here is how the work was
              broken down.

                My team members and I first browsed the project summary and
                communicated our preliminary improvement ideas for the project
                with the company representative. We then brainstormed several
                rough sketches of what needed to be redesigned.

              <p>
                After we had a few ideas, we started making low-fidelity mockups
                based on everyone's sketches. In this process, our main task is
                to present our ideas and accept suggestions from professors,
                teaching assistants, and classmates to decide whether these
                decisions are consistent with the design concept of the project.

                In the final week, we reworked the suggestions and drew the
                high-fidelity model. We then recorded the complete process and
                presented our design. Finally, we presented our design to the
                person in charge, Molly, in the meeting and took notes on
                several suggestions from Molly. After the meeting, we made
                changes to our high-fidelity model based on new suggestions to
                refine our design process.

            In order to better complete the redesign, we looked at how to design
            a good sign up flow for a program and a good user interface. Here
            are some of my findings:

            <p>
              Designing a good registration process for a program involves
              creating a seamless and intuitive process that encourages users to
              register and interact with the platform. Keeping it simple is a
              key principle to consider when designing your registration flow
              and user interface. Therefore, we plan to minimize the steps and
              information required for users to reduce friction and make it easy
              for them to complete the registration process.

            <p>
              We found that using the idea of progressive disclosure is a good
              method for us to design the sign up flow for the Allara program.
              Thus, we decided to break down the sign-up process into manageable
              steps and present them one at a time. Using progressive disclosure
              to gradually reveal information and options to users, guiding them
              through the process without overwhelming them.

            For our first low-fidelity wireframe, we chose designs from our
            sketches that would best solve the problems the client had with the
            site. More specifically, we addressed the problem of users
            potentially being unfamiliar with Allara, uncertain if it suits
            their needs, and being skeptical about the doctors by changing the
            flow of the content, and adding narratives as well as interactive
            elements. In addition, we tried to make choices that would allow
            personalized and inclusive experiences for the users.

            <h4>Treatment History Page</h4>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left">
          Firstly, we changed the flow of content, using ideas from two of our
          <u style="font-weight: normal; color: rgba(245, 158, 158, 1)"
            >sketches</u
          >. In the original version of the site, the screen that checks for
          user eligibility for the program was provided as the third screen, but
          we decided to bring this to the first <em>Welcome Page</em> because we
          thought that this would reduce unnecessary processes for those who are
          not eligible for the program.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
          Secondly, we chose the sketch that
          <u style="font-weight: normal; color: rgba(245, 158, 158, 1)"
            >redesigned the progress bar</u

          </div>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left">
          Thirdly, we used the idea to include
          <u style="font-weight: normal; color: rgba(245, 158, 158, 1)"
            >an additional page to solve the problem of users not knowing who
            Allara is and being skeptical of doctors</u
          >. The purpose of this page was to give a brief introduction to what
          Allara provides in order to motivate the users to go through the
          questions and sign up that follow because in the original website,
          information about Allara was only given near the end of the entire
          process. In <em>Expert Care Page</em>, we used three buttons that
          users could click which would lead to a page that would lead to a
          description of specialists at Allara shown as
          <em>Specialists Page</em>, a detailed description on the medical care
          shown as <em>Medical Care Page</em>, and a detailed description on the
          nutrition support. These buttons were implemented instead of having
          all the details on one page because we did not want to make the screen
          text heavy or for users who are familiar with Allara to have to go
          through the information that they already know. Pictures were added in
          all of the detail pages to allow a visually intuitive understanding
          and to break up the text to decrease the density of text.

          page from one of our sketches. This page was added so that users who
          click “yes” would be directed to the “diagnosed history” page that was
          in the original site, while users who click “no” would skip the
          “diagnosed history” page. The aim of this change was to reduce the
          amount of text that users who do not have previous diagnoses have to
          go through and to increase readability.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
          Fifthly, we also implemented the idea of adding a page after all the
          questions required before the sign-up has been asked. The aim of
          <em>Join Program Page</em> was to give a break point in the process
          where the users are told that they have finished answering the
          questions and to indicate that what is left is to join and sign up for
          the program. Providing a brief sentence on how the questions answered
          so far will be used for a personalized plan when signing up for the
          program, would motivate the users to join the program.

          Moreover, we used the design decision to make a horizontally swipeable
          card of the subscription plans with buttons also included at the top
          to jump to a specific subscription plan to increase readability and to
          add interactive elements for users, shown on
          <em>Uncovered Plan Page</em>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
          Lastly, we implemented the idea to include a
          <u style="color: rgba(245, 158, 158, 1)">Confirmation Page</u> for
          users at the end of the entire process so that they can check the
          information they entered and easily confirm that they have
          successfully joined the program.

          We implemented the following changes based on our client's feedback:
        </h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left">
          <li>
            Added a "continue" button on each page of the specialist, medical
            care, and nutrition support sections to maintain user engagement
            within the signup flow
          </li>
          <li>
            Removed the referral question and the hormonal & metabolic
            evaluation program, as they were no longer relevant
          </li>
          <li>
            Combined bullets 3, 4, and 5 as they all refer to 1:1 visits with
            providers
          </li>
          <li>Removed the community offering</li>
          <li>
            Adjusted the progress bar to end at the review page, making the
            onboarding process appear more manageable
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="text-align: left">
          We also made the following changes based on our peers' feedback:
        </h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left">
          <li>
            Used the expert section from Allara's "About" page to provide
            descriptions on the specialist page
          </li>
          <li>Added more padding to the button text to improve readability</li>
          <li>
            <u style="font-weight: normal; color: rgba(245, 158, 158, 1)"

            <u style="font-weight: normal; color: rgba(245, 158, 158, 1)"

            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Added a "read more" and "read less" button for the "Your insurance
            will be billed for" section on the covered page
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="text-align: left">
          However, we decided not to include some suggestions in this
          low-fidelity iteration:
        </h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left">
          <li>
            Our instructor's suggestion to enhance the visual design will be
            addressed in our high-fidelity prototype.
          </li>
          <li>
            The peer feedback regarding adding color, fun elements, and pictures
            will also be incorporated in the high-fidelity prototype, where we
            can better explore visual design choices.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: left">
          By selectively implementing the most relevant and impactful changes in
          this second iteration, we have created an improved low-fidelity
          wireframe that better aligns with our client's goals and addresses key
          user experience concerns raised by our peers.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
          This iterative process has reinforced the importance of seeking and
          incorporating feedback from multiple stakeholders to refine and
          enhance our design solution. As we move forward to the high-fidelity
          prototyping stage, we will continue to keep the remaining suggestions
          in mind to create a visually engaging and user-friendly onboarding
          experience for Allara Health.

          </h2>
          <p style="color: gray; margin-left: 25px">
            The overall tone remains consistent with the original design, but we
            have added some button/input box effects, accessibility designs,
            icons, and card style designs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <br />

        <div class="rr-content6-feature-boxes-sameline">
          <div class="allara-content6-feature-box">
            <img src="./Assets/VisualStyleGuide.png" alt="VisualStyleGuide" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: left">
          For the design of color, font and size, we chose and kept it
          consistent with the original design to the greatest extent, including
          all of the text sizes, the effect of mouse hover, the color after
          being selected, and the original color of the button, etc. For the
          customer review cards, we also added a three-dot icon for the sliding
          window and made it the same color as the theme color so that it can
          blend in with the page.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
          At the same time, we also made some changes to the original design.
          For example, on the input box, we added a shadow to the selected,
          hover button and input box. In this way, users who are not sensitive
          to color can clearly see the input box they selected.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
          In the design of the icon, we implemented three blue buttons to
          increase the interactivity of the page. Users can expand more content
          by clicking buttons. By browsing this content, users can have a
          clearer understanding of the product and decide whether this program
          is suitable for them. In addition, we also added the checked mark for
          the check box to ensure that color-blind people can also see that they
          have checked this box by the presentation of the checked mark, not
          only the color changing in this box. In the same way, we have
          increased the percentage under the progress bar to better serve the
          visually impaired.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
          Finally, for the card and drop-down box designs, we chose to keep the
          default designs because the client wants us to keep it simple. In
          addition, we believe that the color of the card is close to the
          background color of the page, which may not be conducive to people
          with visual impairments. Therefore, we recommend the client to
          consider using other colors to design cards.

            In the welcome page, we shouldn't include the link to coverage

            In the expert care page, the icon should be replaced with actual
            pictures to make it engaging.

          This was a quick project, lasting only three weeks from start to

          <h4>Collaboration Skills</h4>
          <p>
            I believe that the purpose of group work is not just to complete the
            task. Group work teaches valuable collaboration skills, including
            communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution. Working with group
            members requires effective communication to share ideas, delegate
            tasks, and coordinate efforts to achieve common goals.

          <h4>Time Management</h4>
          <p>
            When working in a group, don't put off all tasks until the end.
            While working with my teammates, I also learned time management
            techniques, as well as the skills of setting deadlines and
            allocating resources to complete tasks within the designated time.
            In fact, effective time management is crucial to meeting project
            deadlines and achieving goals. Otherwise, it may bring great
            psychological pressure to myself or my teammates.
