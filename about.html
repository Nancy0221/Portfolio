          Hello, I'm Lanxi, but you can <i>call me Nancy</i>
        </h3>
        <p>
          I am a software engineer with a diverse background in both academia
          and industry. My journey in computer science began at
          <u>The Ohio State University</u>, where I pursued a Bachelor of
          Science degree with a major in Computer Science. During my time there,
          I maintained a GPA of 3.74 and was honored to be included in the
          Dean's List. I had the opportunity to delve into various aspects of
          computer science, including algorithms and data structures, operating
          systems, computer networks, and principles of programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building upon my undergraduate education, I furthered my studies at
          <u>Brown University</u>, where I earned a Master of Science in
          Computer Science. I maintained a perfect GPA of 4.0 and delved deeper
          into specialized areas such as DBMS, software engineering, computer
          systems security, web applications, and UI/UX design.
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic pursuits have been complemented by hands-on experiences in
          the industry. As an AI Software Engineer Intern at
          <u>Alibaba Group</u>, I collaborated closely with AI development
          engineers, leveraging logistic regression, XGBOOST, and deep neural
          networks to process algorithms and achieve classification.
          Additionally, I contributed to data preprocessing and visualization
          efforts, ensuring the integrity and rationality of the datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my tenure as a Junior Software Engineer Intern at
          <u>Y STEM and Chess</u>, I collaborated with an AI engineer to develop
          a website capable of predicting users' ages based on a set of
          questions. I implemented JWT for user authentication, contributing to
          the website's functionality and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my role as a <u>Teaching Assistant</u> for Computer Systems at The
          Ohio State University, I had the privilege of assisting students in
          grasping complex concepts and navigating their coursework. This
          experience further solidified my understanding of computer systems and
          enhanced my communication and mentorship skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical expertise spans a wide range of programming languages,
          frameworks, databases, and tools. I am <u>proficient in</u> Java,
          HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, TypeScript, Golang, and Python, among
          others. I have <u>hands-on experience with frameworks</u> such as
          Spring, Spring Boot, React.js, Node.js, and Express.js, as well as
          <u>databases</u> like MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis. Additionally, I am
          well-versed in DevOps practices, utilizing <u>tools</u> such as Maven,
          Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Postman, JUnit, ElasticSearch, and Kafka to
          streamline development processes and enhance project efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have demonstrated a
          passion for innovation, a dedication to excellence, and a commitment
          to continuous learning and growth. I am excited about the opportunity
          to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to
          innovative projects and dynamic teams.
